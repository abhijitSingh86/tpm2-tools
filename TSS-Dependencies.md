This page is mostly my notes on the dependencies that the tpm2.0-tools repo has on the TPM2.0-TSS source tree. Sorting out the use of the SAPI / TCTI libraries is pretty trivial. That's under review now and will hopefully be merged soon. The hard part is addressing the bits of the build that directly build source from the TSS tree and link it into an executable. This page will track the files in the TSS tree, what we're using from these source files, and why we need that code. The end goal is sort out a path forward that will decouple these two source trees.

## debug.(c|h)
Function | Consumer | Notes
---------|----------|------
PrintRMDebugPrefix | common.cpp | Function to print a debug level prefix specific to the resource manager. This further implies that we're using debug levels and the constants that define them from the resource manager code. The call to this function is in code that's removed by preprocessor macros in the #if 1 / #else style. This is a common way to switch out code blocks during development / test / debug cycles.
